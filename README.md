# Reliable Transfer Protocol

## Overview
In this laboratory programming assignment, we have written the sending and receiving transport-level code for implementing a simple reliable data transfer protocol. There is two versions of this assignment that will take you progressively from easier to difficult level. The two versions are as follows: 
1. Alternating-bit protocol and 
2. Go-Back-N.

We are given a skeletal code and a network emulator as well in a file called rdt.c. We added the code in this given file.
